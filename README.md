A fork of Otari98/shirsig/sica's Turtle WoW Mail AddOn which, by default, ignors non-AH mail unless "Shift" is  being held while pressing teh "Open Mail" button. 
In other words, "open mail" doesnt eat other player's mail on the 2. page of you mailbox anymore before you get a chance to read it.

# TurtleMail - WoW 1.12 addOn

An extension to the Blizzard mail interface which
- **Automatically opens mail, very rapidly**
- **Mails multiple items at once, very rapidly**
- **Autocompletes recipient names**
- **Icons to show if mail was returned or is from AH**
- **Shows collected gold from opened mails**
- **Apply COD to 1st or all mails**
- **Logging of all sent and received mails**

**\<Right Click>** on inbox items to loot the gold, loot the item and destroy the letter, in that order, if any.<br/>
**\<Right Click>** or **\<Left Drag>** to add inventory items to the attachments.<br/>
**\<Right Click>** to add inventory items to the trade frame.
